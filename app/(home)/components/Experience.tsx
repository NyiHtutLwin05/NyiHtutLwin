          In 2019, I was part of the acquisition team at Shop.com.mm. My role
          involved finding sellers and persuading them to upload their products
          to our e-commerce platform. This experience was challenging yet
          rewarding, as I had to effectively communicate the benefits of our
          platform and build strong relationships with potential sellers.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the acquisition phase, the COVID-19 outbreak occurred, which
          significantly impacted the business. However, this period of
          uncertainty led me to discover a new passion: programming.
          Transitioning to the programming field has been a pivotal moment in my
          career, allowing me to develop new skills and pursue a fulfilling path
          in technology.
